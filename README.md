# Yield oracle 
This is an implementation of on-chain yield oracles, allowing you to permissionlessly deploy oracles to report the yield of interest bearing tokens.

Simply plug in the address of the yield bearing token, or an exchange rate oracle, fund a chainlink upkeep or setup a gelato bot and you're good to go.
